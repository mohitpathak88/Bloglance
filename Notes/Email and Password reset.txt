Points to be noted:

1) For those who struggled like me with this email sending tutorial: 
If you don't receive any email and don't get any error, it seems like Django won't send an email if the email address you submit 
in the form doesn't match the email registered for the user in the DB (specified in the profile and admin pages). 
In other words, I had no errors when I was reseting the passowrd but I wasn't receiving any emails neither. 
After a few hours struggeling, I just changed user email adress so that it matches the one I wanted to send email to and it worked.




2)Just wanted to put a note out there, I was getting an error for "SMTPSenderRefused". The reason being that I put my email 
credentials in an environment variable, but did not refresh my shell (I'm using Linux on WSL). Thus, my environment variables were 
evaluating to nothing, thus the app could not authorize to Gmail. Usually when you add environment variable(s) you need to close
and re-open your terminal to refresh the session. If you're like me as well and had two terminals open (one for running the server,
and one for other tasks), make sure to close them both (or as many as you have open). 
Then you will obviously need to bring the server back up, but that fixed it for me. Hope this helps someone.
